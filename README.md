### Abstract 

The issue of student dropout in higher education represents a critical challenge for national and European academic communities. Despite extensive research on this phenomenon, the precise factors contributing to dropout remain elusive, and no standardized, widely accepted instrument for its measurement currently exists. This study introduces the development of a 15-item questionnaire, specifically designed to identify the factors driving dropout among university students. The questionnaire was distributed to a sample of 3,099 students from all departments of the University of Patras. Confirmatory factor analysis and item response theory were employed to evaluate the Greek Dropout Tool's adaptation and validity. Additionally, the study integrated three established tools—the Burnout Assessment Tool, the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)—to explore the relationships between dropout and related phenomena. The findings provide insights into the underlying causes of dropout and contribute to the development of targeted interventions. 

Keywords: drop out, adaptation, validity, reliability
